Hello world, I'm [Lezou Dali][twitter] (Ivory Coast, west africa, native French Speaker) and a current [Flatiron Fellow][flatiron].  I’ve decided to start blogging because they (flatiron) require us to. But more importantly, I think this is going to help me improve my communication skills and will also be a way to give back to the programming community. I will blog about programming/tech related subject and how I'm learning to be a better programmer. I’ve been programing (seriously) for about a year now. Programming is not easy and it’s time consuming; I consider myself a beginner and probably always will.
The hardest part of about programming for me is one, finding ways to stay motivated and two, not be afraid to look stupid. Blogging is definitely a great way to keep myself motivated. I've been a flatiron fellow for a week now; and I've learned two things. Having instructors can be a great and bad thing, depending on how you use them. Before flatiron, I would google everything I didn't know. Whenever I got stuck on error, I would google that error. I would go to meetups and ask questions when I absolutely couldn't solve the problem after trying for a few days. We learn best from our mistakes. I've realized that during my week at flatiron, I would ask my instructors questions that I could've found out the answer on my own. Questions like "What's the difference between 'git add .' and 'git add -A'". A great developer should have the skill to learn on his own. The  great part about having flatiron instructors is that they use the student-centered teaching style. They act as facilitator to guide us down the learning path; which is a lot better than giving us the answers.

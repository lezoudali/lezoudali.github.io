##About
<img src="/img/lezou_dali.jpeg" class="right" />
My name is **Lezou Dali**. I'm currently learning how to be a better developer at the [Flatiron School][flatiron]. I studied Electrical engineering and math in college but left to pursue a career in web development. Before starting Flatiron School, I was an afterschool instructor. I taught kids how to build and program robot using [Lego Mindstorms][nxt] and [MIT Scratch][scratch]. I've also worked as a research intern at [Brookhaven National Lab][bnl] for two summers. I love teaching and hope to one day teach people to code for a living. When I'm not coding (which rarely happens nowadays), I'm usually listening to music (mostly RnB, Soulful, House and Hip-Hop), watching soccer/football (English Premier League) or basketball (NBA). If you are on twitter, you can follow me [@lezoudali][twitter].
